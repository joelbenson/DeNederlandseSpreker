I"}<p>Iâ€™m on top of Groningen, looking down. The view is beautiful for any building, let along a library! Forum Groningen is an incredible place to study, with its modern appearance and faculties, it provides access to the cities information in many ways.</p>

<p>There are eight floors in the forum, each which caters to its audience with a different feel. On floor two one can play billiards with a friend before using the FREE bathroom. On floor eight one can take a break from studying to gaze across the city and study its architecture. Floor four(?) has another FREE bathroom! I will spend a lot of time here, that is for sure!</p>
